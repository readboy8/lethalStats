# What is LethalStats?
LethalStats is a basic User Interface that allows players to input and track their credits and death stats from the game Lethal Company.
# How To Use
- Select a moon from the dropdown menu underneath the text 'Select Moon'.
- Fill in the 'Credits On Last Run' and the 'Deaths On Last Run' text boxes. Make sure to click confirm once you have ensured the entered info is correct.
- Click the '+1 Attempt' button everytime you finish a moon.
# Future Updates
- Switch to using .json files instead of using pickle to make byte streams. This will allow users to modify their saves.
- Allow users to subtract values from within the UI in the event of a misinput.
- Improve UI look and feel.
- Add more stats to the tracker
